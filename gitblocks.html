                    <p class="side">Git is a version control system; you can think of it as a series of snapshots (commits) of yoru code base. With the creation of each snapshot you build out a whole applicaiton, seeig the growth of a full app. During this time you can make branches to experiment and come back to a previous snapshots you took or merge those experiments into the your app.</p>
                    <h2>What is GitHub?</h2>
                    <p class="side">GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. it lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere using those code snapshots that you took during development.</p>
